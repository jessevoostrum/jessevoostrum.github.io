## About
{: .heading1}
I am a PhD student in the field of mathematics with applications to cognitive sciences under the supervision of Nihat Ay. I study models of perception, action selection and consciousness using information and probability theory, and in particular Bayesian networks.  

Before, I studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge (Part III) and liberal arts and sciences at University College Utrecht.
