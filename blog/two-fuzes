# Two Fuzes

You are in a room with a red button. You have to press the button in exactly 45 minutes. The only things you have to your disposal are two fuzes and a lighter. One fuze takes one hour to burn and the other half an hour. The fuzes burn irregularly, therefore the already burned length does not give any information about the amount of time passed, unless the burned length is the full length of the fuze.
