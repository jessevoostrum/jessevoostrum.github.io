# What is an Explanation?

One often hears statements of the form: $X$ is true because of $Y$. In such a statement $Y$ is an explanation of $X$. The question is when is $Y$ a satisfactory explanation of $X$?


## A simple example for a fully explained statement

Let $a,b,c \in \bN$ and we know $a > b$ and $b > c$.  

Statement: $a > c$. 

Now if a person knows only the statement $a > c$, and asks why that is true, and we say because $a > b$ and $b > c$, then this statement is fully explained. 

This type of "full" explanation relies on the existence of "objective truths" that do not have to explained further, in this case $a > b$ and $b > c$. 


## Explanations are iterative

In many cases, explanations are not that simple as in the example above. Rather than being an objective truth, $Y$ is more often something that requires its own explanation. In this sense explaining something is an iterative process. The deeper you go, the more something is explained.

## Why did Socrates die and information density

A famous questions when studying the topic of explanations is: "Why did Socrates die?". Many different explanations can be given for this, partly parametrised by time. Going back in time a small amount, an explanation could be, because he took poison. However, when one goes back further in time, the same thing can be explained by the fact that he was making people around him angry. In order to choose the best explanation, one could  use information theory. There are two factors that play a role, the mutual information between the explanation and the explanandum, and the degree to which the explanation is parsimonious. The latter could be quantified with a certain to be defined information density.
