# 1001 Bottles of Wine

A nobleman is throwing a big party tomorrow for which he needs a thousand bottles of wine. The person he is buying the wine from gives him instead a thousand one bottles, and reveals that one of the bottles contains poison. Additionally he gives the nobleman 10 mice that he can use to figure out which bottle is poisoned. It takes exactly 24 hours for the mice to respond to the poison, which is only a few hours less than that the guests arrive. How can the nobleman find out in time what bottle is poisoned using only the ten mice?
